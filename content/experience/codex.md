### First Intern Job

I started my career (unofficialy) when i got accepted intern at CODEX by Telkom Indonesia. The company is located at Jakarta under Telkom. CODEX is product that have aim to monitor all employee at Telkom Indonesia. At that time, I mostly learn how backend engineer do and how to work with teams.

I took part in CDP (Codex Dashboard Performance) Squad. Building a monitoring dashboard that can monitoring performance of a person. The dashboard built with standarized telkom's techstack (nodejs, redis, kafka and mongodb). Most of the time is still learn how to use that technology. Learn how to write code under company codebase, writing unit test, using gitflow, and deploying to different environments
