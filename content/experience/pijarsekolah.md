### Trully Sofware Engineer with Great Teams

There's great teams behind great product

Pijar Sekolah is a Digital Product that aims to help schools (mainly teachers and students) to do schools activity such as doing daily task, exams, presence, and annual reporting / transcript. Located at Jakarta, Indonesia.

### On the tecnical side
Pijar Sekolah is built with microservice in mind. So each service can scale up independent each other. Take "exams" feature for example, during exams week (PTS / PAS) the exam service can handle up to 60k users at peak.

I basically take in charge with every backend service. Develop primarily within exams features but at least have developed once in other features. I'am experienced writing code with javascript (nodejs) under specific codebase and pattern, querying data with NoSQL database (MongoDB), using message brokers (kafka) to communicate between service, and caching repeated data with redis.

I also capable to maintain repository (20+ repository at pijarsekolah). Doing code review, merging branch, resolving conflics, upgrading dependency, solving security issues, make sure service running.

### On the non tecnical side
Pijar Sekolah can be considered as medium teams with total Â±50 employees with different big roles (Products, Experience, Developer, Operation and Infra). Each team communicate each other freely on office. Asking something, negotiating features, and presenting result and work.

I'am capable to communicate good enough such as negoitating features within Product Teams to keep inline with timeline / deadline. Discuss with Experience team to make sure design is doable and doesn't have missing journey. Handling custom tickets from user and hotfixing bug reported from Operation teams. Doing production deployment together with infrastucture teams. 

I can also handle appoinment / meetings outside teams. Such as collaboration with other products, tribe or company. Being a representative as a developer teams at pijarsekolah.
